See the top level README for information on where to find the
schematic and programmers reference manual for the ARM processor
on the raspberry pi.  Also find information on how to load and run
these programs.

Based on uart02, the difference is that this is primarily thumb code
instead of ARM.  ARM in this case meaning the traditional 32 bit
instruction set and thumb meaning the traditional 16 bit instruction
subset.  Thumb2 has confused/blurred those definitions though.
(thumb2 is a mostly 32 bit extension to the thumb instruction set using
formerly undefined instructions to create variable word length instructions).

See the top level README for information on how to connect the raspi
uart to your host computer.
