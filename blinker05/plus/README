See the top level README for information on where to find the
schematic and programmers reference manual for the ARM processor
on the raspberry pi.  Also find information on how to load and run
these programs.

Same as blinker05 in the directory above, except the raspberry pi 1
A+ and B+ have two leds one on gpio47 the other gpio35.

I tested this on an A+.  I probably have a B+ around somewhere, but
not sure where.  The A+ does appear to have two leds and they are both
blinking.
