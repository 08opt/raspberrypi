See the top level README for information on where to find the
schematic and programmers reference manual for the ARM processor
on the raspberry pi.

Based on some web searches the gpio is based at address 0x20200000 not
0x7E200000 as shown in the documentation.  I have to go figure that out.

There is a free-running 64 bit timer, super easy to use, just read it.

Based on a couple of experiments, without messing with anything it
appears that the timer is runing at about a megahertz, 1 million ticks
per second.  I am guessing it is divided down from the 700MHz somewhere,
will dig deeper.
