See the top level README for information on where to find the
schematic and programmers reference manual for the ARM processor
on the raspberry pi.  Also find information on how to load and run
these programs.

This simple example sets up a small stack, not much to this program
so the stack doesnt need much room.  It then enables gpio16 as
an output.  Then goes into a loop that sets the gpio, waits, resets it,
waits, repeat.  gpio16 is shown on the schematic to connect to the OK
led.  One of the bank of leds on the corner near the audio out and host
usb ports.  The blink rate for me is a few blinks a second perhaps.
Future examples will get use a timer if there is one and narrow in on
the clock setup, etc.

novectors.s is the entry point for this code.  This just gets things
started then calls a C function (blinker01.c) where the bulk of the
program is found.
