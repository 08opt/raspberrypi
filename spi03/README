See the top level README for information on where to find the
schematic and programmers reference manual for the ARM processor
on the raspberry pi.  Also find information on how to load and run
these programs.

See the top level README for information on how to connect the raspi
uart to your host computer.

This example uses the spi interface with a Nokia 5110 display, these
are probably all recycled from old phones, who knows.  There seems
to be a large quantity of the out there.

I got 5 of them on ebay for $13 with pins.

Perhaps some soldering is required, in some way you need to hook up
the signals.

I use these, but bought the 100 pack

F/F means Female/Female both ends are female which is what you want
if you have a row of pins on yours.

Raspberry Pi signals of interest, all on the P1 connector

alt function 0 for these
GPIO8  SPI0_CE0_N  P1-24
GPIO10 SPI0_MOSI   P1-19
GPIO11 SPI0_SCLK   P1-23

these are set gpio outputs
GPIO7  SPI0_CE1_N  P1-26
GPIO25 GPIO_GEN6   P1-22

power and ground
+3V3               P1-1
GND                P1-25

Now the sparkfun and adafruit and ebay special dont have the same
pinout, the same signals are there but not necessarily in the same
order.  So this chart is not necessarily in the same pin order as your
display.  The names may not exactly match either...

Nokia 5110 to raspi

GND                P1-25    ground
VCC                P1-1     power
DIN (MOSI)         P1-19    data in, spi mosi
SCK/CLK            P1-23    spi clock
D/C                P1-22    data/command
RST                P1-26    reset
CS/CE              P1-24    spi chip select

Your board may have a row of pins above and below the display, they
are the same you only need one row.

The various examples out there use the same init routine.
