See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

This example is for the pi2, see other directories for other flavors
of raspberry pi.  This example switches back to SVC mode from HYP mode.

Also note to make more room for ram the raspberry pi 2 uses a base
address for peripherals of 0x3F000000 where the raspberry pi used
0x20000000.

Also note that for the raspberry pi 2 the arm file copied from the
sd card to ram is kernel7.img  the older raspberry pis still use
kernel.img.

So I have code that switches back to SVC mode, but still more work
to do on this.  In theory all I have to do is change the VBAR, but
that hangs.  So doing it the old fashioned way like I do with the
ARM11 based pis and setting up the exception table at address 0x000
