See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

These examples are for the pi3, see other directories for other
flavors of raspberry pi.

This directory is for aarch32 mode (dont use a config.txt) and switches
from HYP back to SVC mode.

I am going to run with this until it breaks.  The solution still doesnt
work everywhere and way it should, so that is still a mystery.  Thanks
to the folks at the raspberry pi bare metal forum and BSD and Linux and
other sources that all use eret to change the spsr

.globl _start
_start:
    ;@ b skip
    mrs r0,cpsr
    and r1,r0,#0x1F
    cmp r1,#0x1A
    bne skip
    bic r0,r0,#0x1F
    orr r0,r0,#0x13
    msr spsr_cxsf,r0
    add r0,pc,#4
    msr ELR_hyp,r0 ;@ .word 0xe12ef300
    eret           ;@ .word 0xe160006e

So I cant access the VBAR or SCR or others yet so more work to be done.
