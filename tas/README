This is a thumb assembler derived directly from the assembler in my
thumbulator project.  The thumulator version remains the primary
version/home.

I added some hardcoded machine code up front to get from arm to thumb
and then if you bl hexstring, I tack on machine code to implement that
function.  hexstring takes r0 and prints it out on the uart in ascii.

Since I got it working I dont want to just discard it, but not sure
what I want to do with this...I provided binaries for the bootloaders
so that you dont have to have arm tools, which is why you would use tas
because you want to try asm but dont want to try or have failed to build
gnu binutils.  tas should build most anywhere.

One simple test program provided, thats it

./tas test.s

then use a bootloader to load test.s.bin.  Since the test program + tas
require the mini uart to be initialized simply copying test.s.bin to
kernel.img wont do you any good.
