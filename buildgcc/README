A script for building your own gnu toolchain for ARM.

Derived directly from the same script at the mpx project at opencores.org

Keep or change the PREFIX in the script to a path where you want the
binary to end up.

sudo ./build_gcc

then put whatever you had in your prefix/bin in the path.  The default
gnuarm would mean /gnuarm/bin goes in the PATH.


clang script I wrote, builds llvm+clang from sources.
