See the top level README for information on where to find the
schematic and programmers reference manual for the ARM processor
on the raspberry pi.  Also find information on how to load and run
these programs.

Same as blinker02 in the plus directory except the raspberry pi 2
uses a different base address (0x3F000000) than the raspberry pi 1
(0x20000000) likely to make room for more ram but who knows.
