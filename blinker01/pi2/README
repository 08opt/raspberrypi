See the top level README for information on where to find the
schematic and programmers reference manual for the ARM processor
on the raspberry pi.  Also find information on how to load and run
these programs.

Same as blinker01 in the directory above, except the raspberry pi 2
has two leds one on gpio47 the other gpio35

Also note to make more room for ram the raspberry pi 2 uses a base
address for peripherals of 0x3F000000 where the raspberry pi used
0x20000000.

also note that for the raspberry pi 2 the arm file copied from the
sd card to ram is kernel7.img  the older raspberry pis still use
kernel.img.
